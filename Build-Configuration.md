### Intro
Intel RealSense SDK is using **CMake** eco-system to offer useful customization to customers who wish to build the SDK from source.  
> For example, to generate makefile with `BUILD_EXAMPLES` flag turned-on, use the following command line:
`cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=true`
Alternatively, use `cmake-gui` utility to configure and generate your build files.

For build configuration details, please refer to [build-configuration documentation](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/build-configuration)
