### Added

* [rs2_pipeline_get_active_profile](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.8.0/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L127)

* [rs2_config_disable_indexed_stream](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.8.0/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L277)

### Removed
* [rs2_get_stream_profile_size](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_sensor.h#L357) - This function was intended to offer an estimate of USB bandwidth, however USB3 performance is affect by factors other then bytes/second, rendering this method useless
* [rs2_open_pipeline](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L42) - This function was offered to force pipeline configuration prior to streaming. This can be more effectively achieved by [rs2_config_resolve](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.8.0/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L307) and [rs2_config_can_resolve](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.8.0/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L318) 
* [rs2_start_pipeline_with_callback](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L49) -
 and [rs2_start_pipeline_with_callback_cpp](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L57) - Pipeline is always performing synchronization at the moment. If you wish to get minimum latency you can use callback API of the individual sensors
* [rs2_pipeline_get_selection_count](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L120), [rs2_pipeline_get_stream_selection](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L129),  [rs2_pipeline_get_stream_type_selection](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L139),  [rs2_pipeline_delete_selection](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L145) - These methods were redundant

## From [2.7.7](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.7.7) to [2.7.9](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.7.9)

### Moved
* [rs2_get_context_time](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_context.h#L38)
is now available as [rs2_get_time](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/rs.h#L82)
* [rs2_create_pipeline_with_device](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L32)
is now available as [rs2_enable_pipeline_device](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L77)
* [rs2_enable_stream_pipeline](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L82)
is now available as [rs2_enable_pipeline_stream](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L75)
* [rs2_pipeline_get_selection](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L141)
is now available as [rs2_pipeline_get_active_streams](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L112)

### Added
* [rs2_playback_device_stop](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_record_playback.h#L168)
* [rs2_start_queue](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_sensor.h#L223)
* [rs2_open_pipeline](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L42)

### Removed
* [rs2_can_enable_stream_pipeline](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L95) - This method, while useful, was not 100% clearly defined. The same goal was more cleanly achieved in a later release - [rs2_config_can_resolve](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.8.0/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L318)
* [rs2_pipeline_get_extrinsics](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L133) - Extrinsics can be queried between stream profiles, and don't require the pipeline or context.
* [rs2_pipeline_get_context](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_pipeline.h#L176) - Context can be passed to pipeline constructor for dependency injection, but should not be required for anything useful later on.

### Signature Changed
* [rs2_create_pointcloud](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_processing.h#L41) used to accept 2 parameters but

* [rs2_create_align](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.7/include/librealsense2/h/rs_processing.h#L118) used to accept 3 parameters but
[rs2_create_align](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/v2.7.9/include/librealsense2/h/rs_processing.h#L118) accepts 2 parameters!
