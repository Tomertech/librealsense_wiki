## Release 2.8.1
1 Nov 2017

> [API changes](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-Changes#from-280-to-281) from previous release

### New Features and Improvements

* [Depth Quality Tools](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development/tools/depth-quality) now includes Z-Accuracy metric based on ground-truth (DSO-6434)
* librealsense CI now includes recorded test cases for the 4 major supported lines of devices - SR300, D415, D435 and D460 (DSO-7101)
* New example added showcasing the [Sensor API](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/examples/sensor-control) (DSO-7016)
* Set of new examples added showcasing working with [C API](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/examples/C) (DSO-6909)
* Added Python example for working with [D400 Advanced Mode](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/wrappers/python/python-rs400-advanced-mode-example.py) (DSO-7287)
* Added depth colorization options to the Viewer (and the API) (DSO-7150)

### Bug Fixes
* **[Firmware]** When Advance Mode is changed, the camera requires sometimes to disconnect/reconnect (DSO-7015)
* Pipeline fails to choose the correct device when several devices are connected (DSO-7366)
* When requesting 2 streams (such as color and depth) only one frameset is returned in the pipeline, instead of the 2 synchronized streams. (DSO-7202)

### Known Issues
* **[Viewer]** OpenGL tools and samples don't work with some types of Docking Stations(ThinkPad USB3.0 Pro) (DSO-6674)
* Windows - device disconnect events are sometimes not reported (DSO-6813)
* Windows - Soft stability issue: start-stop test hangs when RGB and Depth running together after hundreds of cycles (DSO-6930)
* Changing the gain value while Auto Exposure (AE) is enabled disables AE, this requires manually enabling AE (DSO-6853)
* GUI - The Output Viewer window doesn't show the bottom notifications (DSO-7197)
* Linux - When using IR format that is different than UYVY, the FPS drops to half (DSO-7183)

### Limitations
* **[Firmware]** Sometimes when RGB and Stereo resolutions are at FHD-HD, the RGB camera streaming stops and doesn't return even after turning the Depth Stereo to Off (DSO-6894)
